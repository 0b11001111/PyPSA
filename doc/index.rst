PyPSA is a `free software
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html>`_ toolbox for
simulating and optimising modern power systems that include features
such as conventional generators with unit commitment, variable wind
and solar generation, storage units, coupling to other energy sectors,
and mixed alternating and direct current networks.  PyPSA is designed
to scale well with large networks and long time series. It is pronounced "pipes-ah".

Team and History
================

This project is maintained by the energy system modelling
group at the `Institute for
Automation and Applied
Informatics <https://www.iai.kit.edu/english/index.php>`_ at the
`Karlsruhe Institute of
Technology <http://www.kit.edu/english/index.php>`_. The group is funded by the
`Helmholtz Association <https://www.helmholtz.de/en/>`_ until 2024.
Previous versions were developed by the `Renewable Energy Group
<https://fias.uni-frankfurt.de/physics/schramm/renewable-energy-system-and-network-analysis/>`_
at `FIAS <https://fias.uni-frankfurt.de/>`_ to carry out simulations
for the `CoNDyNet project <http://condynet.de/>`_, financed by the
`German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) <https://www.bmbf.de/en/index.html>`_ 
as part of the `Stromnetze Research Initiative <http://forschung-stromnetze.info/projekte/grundlagen-und-konzepte-fuer-effiziente-dezentrale-stromnetze/>`_.
