PyPSA 0.4.2 (17th June 2016)
============================

This release improved the non-linear power flow performance and
included other small refactorings:

* pf: The non-linear power flow ``network.pf()`` now accepts a list of
  snapshots ``network.pf(snapshots)`` and has been refactored to be much
  more performant.
* pf: Neither ``network.pf()`` nor ``network.lpf()`` accept the
  ``now`` argument anymore - for the power flow on a specific
  snapshot, either set ``network.now`` or pass the snapshot as an
  argument.
* descriptors: The code has been refactored and unified for each
  simple descriptor.
* opt: Constraints now accept both an upper and lower bound with
  ``><``.
* opf: Sub-optimal solutions can also be read out of pyomo.


PyPSA 0.4.1 (3rd April 2016)
============================

This was mostly a bug-fixing and unit-testing release:

* pf: A bug was fixed in the full non-linear power flow, whereby the
  reactive power output of PV generators was not being set correctly.
* io: When importing from PYPOWER ppc, the generators, lines,
  transformers and shunt impedances are given names like G1, G2, ...,
  L1, T1, S1, to help distinguish them. This change was introduced
  because the above bug was not caught by the unit-testing because the
  generators were named after the buses.
* opf: A Python 3 dict.keys() list/iterator bug was fixed for the
  spillage.
* test: Unit-testing for the pf and opf with inflow was improved to
  catch bugs better.

We thank Joao Gorenstein Dedecca for a bug fix.


PyPSA 0.4.0 (21st March 2016)
================================

Additional features:

* New module ``pypsa.contingency`` for contingency analysis and
  security-constrained LOPF
* New module ``pypsa.geo`` for basic manipulation of geographic data
  (distances and areas)
* Re-formulation of LOPF to improve optimisation solving time
* New objects pypsa.opt.LExpression and pypsa.opt.LConstraint to make
  the bypassing of pyomo for linear problem construction easier to use
* Deep copying of networks with ``network.copy()`` (i.e. all
  components, time series and network attributes are copied)
* Stricter requirements for PyPI (e.g. pandas must be at least version
  0.17.1 to get all the new features)
* Updated SciGRID-based model of Germany
* Various small bug fixes

We thank Steffen Schroedter, Bjoern Laemmerzahl and Joao Gorenstein
Dedecca for comments and bug fixes.


PyPSA 0.3.3 (29th February 2016)
================================

Additional features:

* ``network.lpf`` can be called on an iterable of ``snapshots``
  i.e. ``network.lpf(snapshots)``, which is more performant that
  calling ``network.lpf`` on each snapshot separately.
* Bug fix on import/export of transformers and shunt impedances (which
  were left out before).
* Refactoring of some internal code.
* Better network clustering.


PyPSA 0.3.2 (17th February 2016)
================================

In this release some minor API changes were made:

* The Newton-Raphson tolerance ``network.nr_x_tol`` was moved to being
  an argument of the function ``network.pf(x_tol=1e-6)`` instead. This
  makes more sense and is then available in the docstring of
  ``network.pf``.
* Following similar reasoning ``network.opf_keep_files`` was moved to
  being an argument of the function
  ``network.lopf(keep_files=False)``.


PyPSA 0.3.1 (7th February 2016)
===============================

In this release some minor API changes were made:


* Optimised capacities of generators/storage units and branches are
  now written to p_nom_opt and s_nom_opt respectively, instead of
  over-writing p_nom and s_nom
* The p_max/min limits of controllable branches are now p_max/min_pu
  per unit of s_nom, for consistency with generation and to allow
  unidirectional HVDCs / transport links for the capacity
  optimisation.
* network.remove() and io.import_series_from_dataframe() both take as
  argument class_name instead of list_name or the object - this is now
  fully consistent with network.add("Line","my line x").
* The booleans network.topology_determined and
  network.dependent_values_calculated have been totally removed - this
  was causing unexpected behaviour. Instead, to avoid repeated
  unnecessary calculations, the expert user can call functions with
  skip_pre=True.



PyPSA 0.3.0 (27th January 2016)
===============================

In this release the pandas.Panel interface for time-dependent
variables was introduced. This replaced the manual attachment of
pandas.DataFrames per time-dependent variable as attributes of the
main component pandas.DataFrame.
