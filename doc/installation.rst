 Installation
################


PyPSA relies on the following packages which are not contained in a
standard Python installation:

* numpy
* scipy
* pandas
* networkx
* pyomo

It is recommended to use PyPSA with the following additional packages:

* `iPython <http://ipython.org/>`_ for interactive simulations


In a unix-based environment these packages can be obtained with the
`pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_ Python package manager::

    pip install numpy scipy pandas networkx pyomo ipython


To install PyPSA, you need to download the code from the `PyPSA github
repository <https://github.com/fresna/pypsa/>`_ and then add the
directory to your python path.
